#### CVE-2019-0708 | Remote Desktop Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
##### The Crashing Part [BSOD] has been removed intentionally!

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote Desktop Services – formerly known as Terminal Services – when an unauthenticated attacker
connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests.  This vulnerability  is pre-authentication  and  requires  no user
interaction.  An attacker who  successfully  exploited this  vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the  target system. An attacker could
then  install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would  need to send a specially  crafted request to the target systems Remote Desktop Service via RDP.
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Remote Desktop Services handles connection requests.
